- React is a client side javascript library which helps to manuplate the dom easily.
- Javascipt is able to handle dom manuplation thus we use library of js as react.
- Without React we need to write whole code for crateing an element to updating its value using js.
- This approach is called as imperitive approach.

- React is component/declarative focused
